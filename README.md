# Western Boreal Initiative

This is a large, multi-year, multi-agency integrative project between the Canadian Wildlife Service and the Canadian Forest Service, with many collaborators in other Federal departments, provincial governments and territorial governments. We are working under a Co-Production model, with clients, stakeholders, scientists, policy makers, and indigenous groups part of and becoming part of the process.
